# Many Circles

Directly inspired by this fantastic article: https://sighack.com/post/seventy-five-ways-to-draw-a-circle

I wanted to try my hand at designing my own circle variations without much of a concrete goal. I want to hit at least fifty unique circle types and start to introduce them in some of my other projects.

If you want to run them yourself, make sure to download [Processing](https://www.processing.org) and use the Python module. Feel free to reach out to thebuffed@gmail.com if you have any questions.

All of these projects are available with the intention that other people will enjoy and learn from them.
